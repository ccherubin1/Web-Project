		<h1>Portfolio</h1>

		<p>Below are projects I created in my DIG 2000C class. I gained extensive knowledge in creating digital content, including designing images using Photoshop, producing videos with Premiere Pro, and developing websites utilizing HTML.</p>
<div class="section">
		<h5>Imaging Project:</h5>

		<img src="media/imaging_project_craig_cherubin.png" height="400">
		<p>For this imaging project, I was inspired by cybernetic philosophy that has guided my academic and career goals.</p><p>The utilization of technology to further bridge the gaps of connection between other people and our earth.</p><p>Technology isn't separate from nature, it's just a part of life itself.</p>
</div>
		<h5>First Responder:<p>Stop Motion Project Created with 55 photographs.</p></h5>

				<source src="media/first_responder_stop_motion.mp4" type="video/mp4">

			</video>
			<p>For this stop motion project, First Responder, I was inspired by my own preschool ambitions and imagination.</p><p>At the time I wanted to be a firefighter, and I always imagined that my hot wheels could come to life and head to emergencies on their own.</p><p>TThe short follows a first responder hot wheel doing just that.</p>
</div>

		<h5>Hemani Arabesq:<p>Adobe Premiere Pro Project.</p></h5>

		<video width="480" controls>
			<source src="media/hemani_arabesq_video_project.mp4" type="video/mp4">
				<source src="media/hemani_arabesq_video_project.mp4" type="video/mp4">

			</video>
			<p>For this video project I sought to create a mock advertisement for a fragrance dupe of my favorite scent, Atomic Rose by Initio Parfums, that my friends and I found at a local Indo-Pakistani market. </p><p>We were quite amused that it was produced locally, so I embarked on making a 70s style commercial of it to lean into its absurdity.</p>
